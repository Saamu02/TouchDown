# TouchDown
App 6: App develop in SwfitUI for iOS


# Important Points:
- Custom navigation bar
- Use of generics (generics allows us to write a code that is capable of working with different types)
- Lazy Horizontal Grid layout 
- Lazy Vertical Grid layout 
- Environment object (let us share data anywhere its needed, while also ensuring that views stays updated when the data changes) (@State only work for one specific view thatâ€™s why we used environment object )
- Adding Haptics
